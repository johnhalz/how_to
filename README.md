# How To Wiki
Welcome to the JH How To Wiki. This is a static website: <https://johnhalz.github.io/how_to>

## Description
The general idea behind this guide is to have a personal wiki which you can consult and edit to your hearts content! Whether you found an answer after a long search on the web, or want a simple reminder of a terminal command, this guide is here to help!

## Dependencies
This static website is generated with the help of mkdocs, an open-source python documentation tool. The material theme (along with all of its tools) is used for better presentation.

## Usage
To update the website, simply update or add a markdown file to the `docs` folder, then commit and push to the main branch.
