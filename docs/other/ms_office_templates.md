# MS Office Templates
This is a quick guide to help create and use templates in MS Office.

## Creating a Template
You can start to create a template by going opening the office app and heading to "View → Slide Master". You will then be able to see all of the slides that make up the template. You can edit them and rename the per-slide templates.

When finished creating the template, you can save it by doing the following:

=== "Windows"

    Go to "File → Save", and save file with the `.potx` extension to the desired location.

=== "macOS"

    Go to "File → Save as Template..." and save the template to the desired location.

## Set Template Location

Correctly setting the template location is what will determine whether your teamplate shows up in the MS Office app or not.

=== "Windows"

    On Windows you can set the desired location of your personal templates by going to "File → Options → Save → Default personal templates location", and setting the path there.

=== "macOS"

    On macOS you unfortunately cannot set the location of the personal templates, the path is fixed at: `~/Library/Group Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/User Content/Templates`.

    Note that this path is hidden by default, but you can see hidden files in Finder by pressing ++cmd+shift+period++ on the keyboard.
