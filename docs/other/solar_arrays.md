## Introduction
Recently, energy has become a more critical and therefore expensive resource. The ability to produce high-quality electrical energy is becoming increasingly important for countries, as so many people rely on this resource. Without it, accomplishing simple tasks, such as heating a room, keeping food cold, or communicating with others, become more tedious and inefficient. While many methods have been explored, renewable methods provide a way to produce electrical energy whilst having a minimal impact on the surrounding environment.

The most common and inexpensive renewable method for an individual to produce electrical energy is to use solar arrays. Adding a solar array to one's rooftop is becoming increasingly popular in an attempt to alleviate the additional costs that are brought on by energy companies year after year, and as their popularity grows, the more their price decreases. Solar arrays have also been shown to be capable of operating at 80% efficiency for 25-30 years, and still producing energy after that period.

In this guide we will go over the different methods for solar panel mounting and briefly go over the costs of installing such a system on the roof of a private household.

## Solar Array System
A general solar array system is composed of two or three components:

- Solar Array
- Inverter
- Battery (optional for a grid-connected system)

This setup can then be connected to the grid, or remain as an off-grid system.

With a grid-connected system, it is possible to provide extra power back into the grid, therefore 'selling' your power back to the electrical company for a price. Depending on the installed solar array and your location, it is possible to receive more that 1'000 CHF per year with a grid-connected system.

An off-grid system is not connected to the power-grid (as its name suggests), thus making the battery required to store any collected energy.

### Installation Possibilities
As solar arrays are becoming more common, many different installation methods are becoming available on the market. It is even possible to buy a kit and mount them yourself. We will also go over how a DIY setup compares with the more common methods for installation.

## Method for Roof Installation
It is obviously preferable to avoid large modifications to the building when installing solar arrays, as such installations can increase costs drastically, as well as delay the entire process. It is also important to use proper materials that will survive different weather conditions that they are subjected to over the lifespan of the array.

A newer method from a company [K2 Systems](https://legacy.k2-systems.com/en/products) uses simple weights placed onto aluminium extrusions. This makes the installation easy, as no holes need to be drilled into the roof, and reliable, as the aliminium extrusions are well suited to extreme weather conditions. The solar array are therefore laid onto the roof, making it easy to replace or change the arrangement if needed in the future.

## Solar Panel Mounting Optimization
There are two common mounting options when mounting panels onto your roof. The first is south-facing panel (for those who live in the northern hemisphere), and the second is east-west facing panels. It is important to know which arrangement is being recommended, as this will greatly influence the ability for the system to produce maximum power. Let's look at a side-view of both systems:

We can see in the figure above, that the south orienting panels have gaps in between the panels, as shade is created by the panel in front. In the east-west configuration, the only gap between the panels is to allow for maintenance space.

There is an online calculator tool provided by the European Commission where you can calculate the optimal exposure to the sun: <https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/tools.html>

You can input your location in Europe and it can optimize the slope and azimuth angle of the panels for you. In previous years, with high-priced panels, the south-facing configuration was preferred to save on cost of the panels, but as solar panels have decreased in price, *optimizing for the roof performance is preferable tha optimizing for panel performance*.

Then why is the south-facing configuration still offered as an option?
